# Digits_sequence_detector

## Short description

Program that can recognize sequences of digits (up to 6 digits).

## Setup

Simply use Google Colaboratory, it's very good data science environment.

## Gathering data and training

You can gather data and train model in 3 ways:

1. Create synthetic data using different fonts.
2. Create synthetic data by concatenating MNIST digits.
3. You can also use your own, custom training data.

Text cells and code are self-explanatory.
If you want to change number of generated synthetic samples, you must change SAMPLES variable.
